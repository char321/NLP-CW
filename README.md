### Run
- No extra file needed, just instaill the packages required and run the code in the file.

### Possible Issue
- Out of memory: Try to use smaller batch size. (It works well on paperspace pro machine)
- Different final result: We failed to set up seed for the trainer. But the final result should be close as we described.

### Match with Report
- To match the content in report, search "Section X.X", e.g., "Section 3.1" to locate the code/implementation mentioned in the report.

### Others
- The code might a little bit messy because we comment a lot, and we wanna keep everything we tried in the code to show our effort :)
