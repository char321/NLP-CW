# NLP-CW

### Run
No extra file needed, just instaill the packages required and run the code in the file.

### Possible Issue
out of memory: try to use smaller batch size. (It works well on paperspace pro machine)

### Match with Report
To match the content in report, search "Section X.X", e.g., "Section 3.1" to locate the code/implementation described in the report.

### Others
The code might a little bit messy because we comment a lot, and we wanna keep everything we tried in the code to show our effort :)
