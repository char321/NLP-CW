### Run
- No extra file needed, just instaill the packages required and run the code in the file.

### Possible Issue
- Out of memory: Try to use smaller batch size. (It works well on paperspace pro machine)
- Different final result: We failed to set up seed for the trainer. But the final result should be close as we described.

### Match with Report
- To match the content in report, search "Section X.X", e.g., "Section 3.1" to locate the code/implementation mentioned in the report.
- We comment 
  - Dataset Analysis: "Section 2", "Section 2.1"
  - Model: "Section 3.1", "Section 3.2", "Section 3.3", "Section 3.4", "Section 3.5", "Section 3.6", "Section 3.7"
  - Analysis: "Section 4.1", "Section 4.2", "Section 4.3"
- The log information in the notebook contains the final result of the model (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

### Others
- The code might a little bit messy because we comment a lot, and we wanna keep everything we tried in the code to show our effort :)
